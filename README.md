Automates Process of Creating PDF Headers for PSA Reports

This project is intended to automate the process of creating PDF headers for PSA Reports. The reports are normally made up of a main report, calculation attachments, wind and seismic attachments, and Caesar II output attachments.

The process of adding headers to these documents using Adobe Acrobat can be tedious and time consuming. This project aims to vastly reduce the time it takes properly add headers to the report documents.

This repo hosts a Google Colab Notebook (.ipynb) file. 

Note: the PDF documents that will receive the headers should be Saved as PDF file instead of "PDF Printed". Otherwise the program will not be able to properly read the file.
